Hi 

This is my first attempt at creating a personal website. A website that will be available for future employees to develope their first opinions about me. This website is pretty straightforward that users all of my skills in frontend development to create a unique user friendly and aesthetically pleasing modern day website with personality and functionality. Full responsive and interactive with links to all my previous builds.

This website is design to show off my skills as a frontend developer.

The first build that I'm openly putting out there to judged!

I hope you enjoy it
